# [Takeout Tuesdays](#Takeout-Tuesdays)

Takeout Tuesdays is a personal event of mine, where data takeout is prioritized once a week on Tuesday. This tradition started for me on 2023, Tuesday, June 6th. You can adopt the tradition as well if you want.

This repository is for documenting the event, and the history of my commitment towards it.
