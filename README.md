# [Takeout Tuesdays](#Takeout-Tuesdays)

Takeout Tuesdays is a personal event of mine, where data takeout is prioritized once a week on Tuesday. This tradition started for me on 2023, Tuesday, June 6th. You can adopt the tradition as well if you want.

This repository is for documenting the event, and the history of my commitment towards it.

## [Rationale](#Rationale)

It is a good idea to have a backup of your online accounts, as the servers that host them could terminate your account at any time, either randomly, due to a violation, or because the company ceases to exist. **Not backing up your online accounts is similar to not backing up your computer regularly**. I myself have had to learn this lesson the hard way far too many times (most recent: 2023, Tuesday, June 13th, when my laptop had a kernel panic and almost didn't turn back on, I made the mistake of not backing up for over 3 weeks. I am now preparing to backup my computer hourly because of this, I just have to wait for 5 USB drives to arrive)
