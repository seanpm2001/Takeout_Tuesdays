DESCRIPTION:Takeout Tuesdays\n\nToday is Takeout Tuesday\, please focus you
 r efforts on data takeouts today. It doesn't take very long. It will take b
 etween 1 minute and 30 minutes depending on what you do. Please note that d
 ata takeout is not always instant\, and that some sites will make you wait 
 to get your data (such as Twitter\, which waits 24 hours before starting to
  do a data takeout) if needed\, start the data takeout the day before\, and
  download the archive the next day.\n\nTips:\n\n- Add a secondary event to 
 your calendar each week\, with plans on what site you want to take out\n- T
 hink of all of the websites you use (that you have an account on) and make 
 a list.\n- Make sure you have enough free space. Some site takeouts range f
 rom a few kilobytes (FreeCodeCamp) to 9 megabytes or more (Twitter) while s
 ome site takeouts can take significant amounts of storage (in dire situatio
 ns\, sometimes even over 8 terabytes)\n\nAbout Takeout Tuesdays\n\nüíΩÔ∏è 
 Takeout Tuesdays is an event where data takeout is prioritized once a week 
 on Tuesday. https://github.com/seanpm2001/Takeout-Tuesdays/
