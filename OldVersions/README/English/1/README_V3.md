Takeout Tuesdays is a personal event of mine, where data takeout is prioritized once a week on Tuesday. This tradition started for me on 2023, Tuesday, June 6th. You can adopt the tradition as well if you want.

This repository is for documenting the event, and the history of my commitment towards it.

## [Rationale](#Rationale)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (rationale)]</b></p></summary>

It is a good idea to have a backup of your online accounts, as the servers that host them could terminate your account at any time, either randomly, due to a violation, or because the company ceases to exist. **Not backing up your online accounts is similar to not backing up your computer regularly**. I myself have had to learn this lesson the hard way far too many times (most recent: 2023, Tuesday, June 13th, when my laptop had a kernel panic and almost didn't turn back on, I made the mistake of not backing up for over 3 weeks. I am now preparing to backup my computer hourly because of this, I just have to wait for 5 USB drives to arrive)

## [Reminder to myself and others](#Reminder-to-myself-and-others)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (reminder to myself and others)]</b></p></summary>

I didn't start Takeout Tuesday with the best mindset, as I value my Twitter accounts very little, and only archived them, as I knew they were going to be deleted (either by Twitter, or by me) however, I need to remind myself that these data takeouts are for **backing up** and **not solely** for **backing up and deleting**. Some accounts I am now backing up are ones which I don't plan to delete anytime soon, but they still need to be backed up occasionally.

- **Planned date:** `2023, Tuesday, June 27th`
- **Actual date:** `2023, Monday, June 26th`
- **Takeout targets:** `Discord` ***{*** `SeanWallaWalla` ***}***
- **Note:** `I accidentally started this takeout over 8 days ago, and then finished the takeout on Monday, as I prepared the archive, but forgot to wait until the next day. The data is pretty small compared to Twitter, and not everything was saved (some images were not saved) but I now have a backup of my Discord servers, which is a relief. I didn't post too many images on Discord. I just have to takeout my other Discord account next week.`
