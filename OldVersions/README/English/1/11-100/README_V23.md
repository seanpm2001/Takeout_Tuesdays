Takeout Tuesdays is a personal event of mine, where data takeout is prioritized once a week on Tuesday. This tradition started for me on 2023, Tuesday, June 6th. You can adopt the tradition as well if you want.

This repository is for documenting the event, and the history of my commitment towards it.

I try to update this repository once per week. If I don't get to an update on Tuesday, I will either catch back up on Wednesday or Thursday, although this isn't ideal.

## [Rationale](#Rationale)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (rationale)]</b></p></summary>

It is a good idea to have a backup of your online accounts, as the servers that host them could terminate your account at any time, either randomly, due to a violation, or because the company ceases to exist. **Not backing up your online accounts is similar to not backing up your computer regularly**. I myself have had to learn this lesson the hard way far too many times (most recent: 2023, Tuesday, June 13th, when my laptop had a kernel panic and almost didn't turn back on, I made the mistake of not backing up for over 3 weeks. I am now preparing to backup my computer hourly because of this, I just have to wait for 5 USB drives to arrive)

## [Reminder to myself and others](#Reminder-to-myself-and-others)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (reminder to myself and others)]</b></p></summary>

I didn't start Takeout Tuesday with the best mindset, as I value my Twitter accounts very little, and only archived them, as I knew they were going to be deleted (either by Twitter, or by me) however, I need to remind myself that these data takeouts are for **backing up** and **not solely** for **backing up and deleting**. Some accounts I am now backing up are ones which I don't plan to delete anytime soon, but they still need to be backed up occasionally.

- **Notes:** `I started to attempt data takeouts on 2023, Monday, July 3rd. It was difficult. I could not figure out the account information for my secondary GitHub account, so I will have to wait for my Pangolin to come back before trying again. In the meantime, I tried Quora, which outright refused, so I then tried Reddit. It is a little bit hostile, and it seems like data takeout is going to take a while, as I still have not received a response as of 2023, Wednesday July 5th. I also found that on the day I tried this was my 5th year anniversary of my Reddit account. How has it already been 5 years?`

I have put some extra work into setting up my Mastodon account, but have to wait until a little after 7:00 pm today before I can request another archive.

- **Date:** `2023, Tuesday, September 5th`
- **Actual date:** `2023, Friday, September 1st`
- **Takeout targets:** `Facebook` ***{*** `SeanWallaWalla3` ***}*** `Google Photos` ***{*** `SeanWallaWalla` ***}***
- **Note:** `I didn't completely abide by the Tuesday target, but I still did a backup this week, so it somewhat counts. On 2023, Friday, September 1st, I archived my old Facebook account (not my old, old one, which I still cannot find) as I found that it somehow still existed. It was a quick backup. Later on, I went to do a data takeout of Google Photos, thinking it would be a quick backup of less than 10 gigabytes. This ended up actually taking 5 days and counting, 4 days to download all of the data, and 1 day (and still counting) on extracting and organizing the data. It ended up being nearly 540 gigabytes in size, as for some reason, Google backed up almost every photo and video on every device I had signed into, which is creepy, and pretty excessive. Nonetheless, it was still helpful, as it retained photos from as far back as the 1980s/1990s (from before I was born) that were on some of my devices at certain points in time. I am now one step closer to being able to DeGoogle. In the process, I had to use Windows 10 and Windows 11 on 2 different computers, as Ubuntu wanted to use up RAM for every byte I downloaded, which caused it to run out of both primary and secondary memory too quickly (I was also low on disk space) After a few days, I have come to a conclusion that Windows is unfortunately still more memory efficient than Ubuntu, and this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed, as my laptop has 32 gigabytes of RAM, and was still outperformed in this one aspect by something 8x less (yes, I know about` [linuxatemyram](https://www.linuxatemyram.com/) `unfortunately, the OOM killer will still come for my browser if I try to download too much, meaning there is still a problem, as it starts fluctuating SWAP usage) I am not sure whether this applies to other Linux distributions. What I did with 4 gigabytes of RAM would have taken Ubuntu hundreds of gigabytes of RAM.`

- **Takeout targets:** `Google Play Books` ***{*** `SeanWallaWalla` ***}***
- **Note:** `I am starting to slowly backup my main Google account, so that it is closer to deletion. I didn't want to make the same mistake as last week, as that took a lot of time and hard drive space, so I went for something I knew would be light. For some reason, Google only shows 50 services available for takeout, and I know they have way more than this (since dead services were included in this count) Google Play Books wasn't a very exciting data takeout, as it only exported the titles and links to the books, and not the actual book data. It was also under 400 kilobytes in total. I hope to do something more interesting next week.`

It does not actually include game save data. It was interesting to see my achievements, and how the achievement system works though. It was a small takeout, taking up about 1 megabyte when uncompressed (535.0 kilobytes when compressed) I also hope to update the TRDLF project soon, as it has been without an update for over a month now.
