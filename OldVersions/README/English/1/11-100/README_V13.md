Takeout Tuesdays is a personal event of mine, where data takeout is prioritized once a week on Tuesday. This tradition started for me on 2023, Tuesday, June 6th. You can adopt the tradition as well if you want.

This repository is for documenting the event, and the history of my commitment towards it.

I try to update this repository once per week. If I don't get to an update on Tuesday, I will either catch back up on Wednesday or Thursday, although this isn't ideal.

## [Rationale](#Rationale)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (rationale)]</b></p></summary>

It is a good idea to have a backup of your online accounts, as the servers that host them could terminate your account at any time, either randomly, due to a violation, or because the company ceases to exist. **Not backing up your online accounts is similar to not backing up your computer regularly**. I myself have had to learn this lesson the hard way far too many times (most recent: 2023, Tuesday, June 13th, when my laptop had a kernel panic and almost didn't turn back on, I made the mistake of not backing up for over 3 weeks. I am now preparing to backup my computer hourly because of this, I just have to wait for 5 USB drives to arrive)

## [Reminder to myself and others](#Reminder-to-myself-and-others)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (reminder to myself and others)]</b></p></summary>

I didn't start Takeout Tuesday with the best mindset, as I value my Twitter accounts very little, and only archived them, as I knew they were going to be deleted (either by Twitter, or by me) however, I need to remind myself that these data takeouts are for **backing up** and **not solely** for **backing up and deleting**. Some accounts I am now backing up are ones which I don't plan to delete anytime soon, but they still need to be backed up occasionally.

- **Planned date:** `2023, Tuesday, June 27th`
- **Actual date:** `2023, Monday, June 26th`
- **Takeout targets:** `Discord` ***{*** `SeanWallaWalla` ***}***
- **Notes:** `I accidentally started this takeout over 8 days ago, and then finished the takeout on Monday, as I prepared the archive, but forgot to wait until the next day. The data is pretty small compared to Twitter, and not everything was saved (some images were not saved) but I now have a backup of my Discord servers, which is a relief. I didn't post too many images on Discord. I just have to takeout my other Discord account next week.`

### [Takeout Tuesday 5](#Takeout-Tuesday-5)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this entry]</b></p></summary>

- **Date:** `2023, Tuesday, July 4th`
- **Takeout targets:** `Discord, Quora, Reddit` ***{*** `SeanWallaWalla` ***}***
- **Notes:** `I started to attempt data takeouts on 2023, Monday, July 3rd. It was difficult. I could not figure out the account information for my secondary GitHub account, so I will have to wait for my Pangolin to come back before trying again. In the meantime, I tried Quora, which outright refused, so I then tried Reddit. It is a little bit hostile, and it seems like data takeout is going to take a while, as I still have not received a response as of 2023, Wednesday July 5th. I also found that on the day I tried this was my 5th year anniversary of my Reddit account. How has it already been 5 years?`

Data takeout didn't finish by 2023, Tuesday, July 11th, but my Reddit takeout from 8 days ago finished at around 4:00 pm today. It was a disappointment.

- **Notes:** `I started a data takeout of my Reddit account the day before Tuesday. I was expecting it to take time, like it did last time, but it actually went way faster than expected, finishing a few hours before I went to bed.

- **Notes:** `Data takeout was done on the right day today. I decided that going forward, I won't have it go on Monday or earlier, even if it is expected to take past Tuesday. I did a takeout of my Mastodon account today, I was going to do a different site, but decided it would be too much work. I am getting interested in further usage of Mastodon, but I need to free up some time first. I did the data takeout today regardless.`

- **Notes:** `Data takeout was done on the right day today. I decided to go for multiple takeouts in one week, but failed, as archive.org doesn't seem to allow takeout. I have put some extra work into setting up my Mastodon account, but have to wait until a little after 7:00 pm today before I can request another archive. I also decided not to update the TRDLF (The REAL Data Liberation Front) project today, with plans to instead work on it tomorrow.`
